PoolSite
========

A repository for the website OfficePoolHub.com.

The site is written in Python using the Django Framework and is used to mange Office Pools like Oscar Pools, and the March Madness Tournament.

I created this project from the ground up so that I could hone my skills in Django and to see if I can launch entire functioning website with user registration and all, on my own.
